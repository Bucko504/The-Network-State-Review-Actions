A review of The Network State
 A very informative book , covering a wide range of history and possible futures of goverments, coruption, nations, crypto and a possible American Civil War.
 As a Western from the south in the USA. What most would call a "Cospiracy Theorist" the last 20 years. 
 I agree with alot of the information and most of the possible futures.
 However I dont think a true Network Society could ever reach its full potential ,without losing all of its physical assests, thru military force.
 Just as I dont believe a true poltician who wanted to do good , could ever get into a high enough position of power to make any change.
 In the last US election we had over 1100 canidates running for office, but yet most media only talked about 2 or 4 canidates. 
 The requirements alone to get a presidential nomination on the ballot in every state of the USA is very time and money consuming to say the least.
 Yet even if all those requirements are met, have yet to see an election in my life time that wasnt met with question or shown to have legitamacy.

However I do have a small hope/idea for the country/goverment I was born in/under , the USA and hopefully thru it , the people of the world.
THe One Commandment Chapter in the book works well with the idea. Even though I dont believe the US elections to be legit, it perhaps can be used to prove the corruption.
I think if we were to create a political party with a One Commandment in mind. One Commandment so popular almost everyone will have to agree with it, transparency.
To make every aspect of goverment operations, except maybe military spending at first, as transparent as possible.  

This Political Party Canadidate needs to get very popular and stay very transparent.
I'm thinking like live streaming 24/7 to show their commitment to transparency, like a reality tv show. With Promises to continue after the election, if elected.
A continuous campaigne , muliple years or even multiple elections years, to support this One Commandment politcal party on transparency in goverment and politics.
The Person/Party/Network needs to go very viral, so that everyone cant help but talk about their party/network/movement they are voting for next election.

In my opinion In this perfect scenerio was to unfold , the current parties would not give up what they have and this new canidate would lose thru corruption/cheating.
However an Idea this big , with corruption so obviouss , could be the motivation to possibly start the largest march on washington .
A peaceful goverment turnover to new One Commandement Party, Tipping point to the second American Civil war , or back to the same Routine.
Then Perhaps the elections are legit and this party/canidate/now president uses the network to trully make goverment transparent , gain trust for future generations.

I personally hope for a future were money and crypto are not needed. Where board members for business and goverments are all worried about whats best for society
and not whats best for proftis or the board members. Along the lines of taking the work needed to keep the infrastucture running/productive divided by the number of
people that want to particpatein the future network. All goverment data on a Blockchain, decisions controlled by online network of the brightest minds in the fields, 
soul tokens tied to social security numbers public and private. Bright Dreams that I could talk for hours on but not here/now.

A great read of a book overall , and I wish any political party in the west would do any thing truly benefical for society that doesnt invlove wasting large 
somes of money due to corruption and greed.
